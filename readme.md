# Haris Malik's C++ and Data Structures & Algorithms Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository dedicated to documenting my journey in learning C++ and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). This README serves as a reference for myself and anyone else interested in exploring these topics alongside me. 

## About Me

I'm Haris Malik, a passionate full-stack web developer with expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Laravel, and more. You can find out more about me and my work on my website [malikharis.in](https://malikharis.in).

## Journey Start Date

My journey into the realms of C++ and DSA officially began on March 27, 2024.

## What to Expect

In this repository, I'll be covering various topics related to C++ programming language, as well as diving deep into Data Structures & Algorithms. Expect to find a mix of code snippets, explanations, and notes as I progress through my learning journey.

## Current Focus

At the outset, my focus will be on mastering the fundamentals of C++ syntax and semantics. From there, I'll gradually transition into implementing various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, and understanding the algorithms associated with them.

## Repository Structure

- **Code Snippets**: This directory will contain standalone code snippets demonstrating specific concepts or techniques in C++.
  
- **Data Structures**: Here, I'll organize implementations of different data structures using C++.
  
- **Algorithms**: I'll document various algorithms along with their implementations in this directory.
  
- **Notes**: This section will serve as my personal notes, capturing key insights, observations, and learnings from my journey.

## Contribution
